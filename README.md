## Project Overview
- **Project Title:** Spotify Recommender
- **Project Purpose:** This project exists to explore and analyze how recommending algorithms in our everyday lives function, such as a Spotify song recommender. We built an application with a machine learning model embedded using Python, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- **Project Objectives**:
  - Utilized a publicly accessed dataset and analyze trends.
  - Create Tableau dashboards with data visualizations to tell a story of Spotify songs and genres
  - Create an application that has a machine learning model form that receives a user input and makes predictions.

### Our motivation to use this topic:

- The inspiration of this project was to take a personal look at how the recommender systems in our everyday lives work. When you are watching Netflix, how do they decide what we should watch next? When you buy something online, how do they decide what we also might like? Specifically, for this project, if not using a playlist, how does Spotify decide what song I might want to listen to next? As we all love listening to music and are always looking for that new song we can’t stop playing or get out of our head, how can we make finding this song easier? During this project we were able to see how machine learning answers some of these questions we have.

### Analysis:

- recommender systems in our everyday life likely use a supervised classification model learning from features of the product the algorithm is trying to recommend. For this project we used k-Nearest Neighbors, but it would be interesting to see what companies like Spotify, Apple Music, Netflix, and Amazon recommend songs, movies, and products based on users past experiences. There are endless amounts of opportunities to optimize machine learning models to achieve your expected outcome. This is the fun of machine learning because there is no limit for what you can achieve!

### Datasets Used:

- We chose a dataset that consisted of Spotify tracks and their respective features. We got this dataset from Kaggle (link found in Works Cited section). This data was originally collected from the Spotify API. Our dataset consisted of the Spotify unique track identifier, the track name, artists, the album name the song belongs to, the song’s genre, and how popular each song is. The popularity is calculated by algorithm and is based, in the most part, on the total number of plays the track has had and how recent those plays are. Generally speaking, songs that are being played a lot now will have a higher popularity than songs that were played a lot in the past. In addition to the details of each track, the dataset also consisted of features for each song. These features included track duration, explicitness, danceability, energy, key, loudness, “speechiness”, acousticness, and more.
  
- In order to create insightful Tableau dashboards we also decided to use another Spotify track playlist consisting of the most streamed songs in 2023. This dataset was also from Kaggle. Similarly, this dataset consisted of the song details and features such as track duration, explicitness, danceability, energy, key, loudness, “speechiness”, acousticness, and more. In addition, this dataset also consisted of how many Spotify user playlists the song was in, but also other users of other music streaming services such as Apple Music and Deezer. Unlike our previous dataset, it also consisted of the date when the song was released.


### Navigating this repository:

- Before building our application, we did some Exploratory Data Analysis which can be found in the Jupyter Notebooks located in the "EDA Notebooks" directory
- Our project proposal and final presentation can be found in the "Reports" directory.
- All of our application engineering can be found in the "app" directory
- All of our datasets directly from Kaggle and cleaned can be found in the "Resources" directory
